# note: I still do not know how to create different path maps for solc. TokenMarket contracts refer to Zeppelin contracts.
# However regardless where you run solc it assumes Zeppelin contracts are within the current working directory
# under zeppelin folder. This is a workaround if you want to invoke populus compile not under this path,
# but some other path and get Populus testrpc fixture working.
# This is mainly a workaround to get our internal test suite to complete. Before this could be maintained
# using a symbolic link, but Docker volume mounts ignore symbolic links.
